            <h2>The History Of The Mardi Gras</h2>
            <br><br>
            <p>The origins of Mardi Gras can be traced to medieval Europe, passing through Rome and Venice in the 17th
                and 18th centuries to the French House of the Bourbons. From here, the traditional revelry of "Boeuf
                Gras," or fatted calf, followed France to her colonies.</p>
            <p>On March 2, 1699, French-Canadian explorer Jean Baptiste Le Moyne Sieur de Bienville arrived at a
                plot of ground 60 miles directly south of New Orleans, and named it "Pointe du Mardi Gras" when his
                men realized it was the eve of the festive holiday. Bienville also established "Fort Louis de la
                Louisiane" (which is now Mobile) in 1702. In 1703, the tiny settlement of Fort Louis de la Mobile
                celebrated America's very first Mardi Gras.</p>
            <p>New Orleans was established in 1718 by Bienville. By the 1730s, Mardi Gras was celebrated openly in
                New Orleans, but not with the parades we know today. In the early 1740s, Louisiana's governor, the
                Marquis de Vaudreuil, established elegant society balls, which became the model for the New Orleans
                Mardi Gras balls of today.</p>
            <p>1872 was the year that a group of businessmen invented a King of Carnival, Rex, to preside over the
                first daytime parade. To honor the visiting Russian Grand Duke Alexis Romanoff, the businessmen
                introduced Romanoff's family colors of purple, green and gold as Carnival's official colors. Purple
                stands for justice; gold for power; and green for faith. This was also the Mardi Gras season that
                Carnival's improbable anthem, "If Ever I Cease to Love," was cemented, due in part to the Duke's
                fondness for the tune.</p>

            <h2>Mardi Gras Traditions</h2>
            <br><br>
            <p>Mardi Gras is about music, parades, picnics, floats and excitement. It's one big holiday in New Orleans!
            </p>
            <p>Revelers know to wear costumes or at least dress in purple, green, and gold, and adorn themselves with
                long beads caught from the floats of previous parades. You'll see a lot of crazy costumes, kids with
                their families are everywhere, and both locals and visitors having a great time. Parade goers will sit
                on the ground, throw balls, play music, eat great food and watch the crowds walk by between parades. On
                Mardi Gras day, the majority of non-essential businesses are shut down because of the celebration.</p>
            <p>Experienced revelers know to bring a large bag with them so they can haul away all the beads and
                trinkets they will catch from the parades!</p>
            <p>Every year, we get a lot of questions about how it all begin, and how the traditions have changed.
